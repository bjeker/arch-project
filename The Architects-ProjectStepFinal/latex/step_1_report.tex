\section{Objective}

To introduce the process and methodology of designing a new computer circuit from scratch by coding 4-bit Binary Functions And, Nand, Or, Nor, Xor, Xnor, Not, and a Shifter. 4-bit arithmetic operations Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication all including carry in and carry out circuits. The ALU functions were then integrated into a control circuit. This circuit controls user input in hexadecimal coded in to choose which ALU function output to display..

\section{Verilog Code}
To design our Verilog control Circuit we decided on Operation Codes for each module. The Operation Codes in hexadecimal are: 

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
       AND  & 0 \\
       NAND  & 1 \\
       OR & 2 \\
       NOR & 3 \\
       XOR & 4 \\
       XNOR & 5 \\
       NOT & 6 \\
       SHIFT & 7 \\
       ADD & 8 \\
       SUBTRACT & 9 \\
       MULTIPLY & A 
    \end{tabular}

\section{Conclusion}
In order to create our 4-bit modules in Verilog, we had to determine how to store 4-bit numbers in registers and wires. Addition was the most straightforward to code with Carry-In and Carry-Out values.  In our multiplication module, we found that the product of two 4-bit numbers needed to be 8-bits in order to properly implement the Carry-Out of the module. The multiplication module gave us the most trouble as we couldnâ€™t decide what size the output product should be. The logic gates were quick to get through using 4-bit values as they are built into the Verilog code as operators. We imported each ALU function and connected them to a control circuit. From the control circuit, we were able to have a user input to choose the desired ALU function. From here, the control circuit would select the output for the user chosen function in hexadecimal coded in after running every function. Each operation was run in two test cases.
